# Listed Dashboard App

## Plugins used:
1. Fetched API (Axios) -  GitHub - public-apis/public-apis: A collective list of free APIs (Polygon.io)
2. Authentication (GoogleOAuth) -  https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=listed-384307

## Note:
The dashboard that I have created is working smoothly with dummy data fetched via API (Polygon.io). The data is being updated regularly and displayed accurately on the dashboard.

To ensure the security and authenticity of the dashboard, I have implemented Google Authentication using OAuth. The login page of the dashboard features a "Sign in with Google" button, which has been set as the default login method via OAuth. This ensures that only authorized users can access the dashboard.

However, please note that the "Sign in with Google" button on the login page cannot be styled as it is controlled by OAuth. It is a standard feature that is provided by Google and cannot be customized according to the design preferences.

Solution is hosted in "Vercel"  (  https://listed-azure.vercel.app  ).

I hope that the completed assignment meets your expectations. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
